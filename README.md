# PyTorch Implementations from Scratch

This repository contains my custom implementations of various models using PyTorch. The models includes all of these categories of models.
 
 - Computer Vision
 - Natural Language Processing
 - Generative AI
 - Vision-Language (Multimodel)
 

 **Computer vision** models are designed to translate visual data based on features and contextual information identified during training. This enables models to interpret images and video and apply those interpretations to predictive or decision making tasks. This repository contains some of the most famous models like ResNet, EfficientNet and YOLO.

**Natural Language Processing** models are desined to process textual data and manipulate human language or data that resembles human language. NLP models work by finding relationships between the constituent parts of language for example, the letters, words, and sentences found in a text dataset. NLP architectures use various methods for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and modeling. This repository contains Bidirectional LSTM, seq2seq and Masked language models.


**Generative AI** models are desined for learnign any kind of data distribution using unsupervised learning. All types of generative models aim at learning the true data distribution of the training set so as to generate new data points with some variations. Two of the most commonly used and efficient approaches are Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). This repository contains various models improved based on GAN and VAE. Recently a new group of models introduced in this area called Diffusion models. They also will be added soon.

**Vision-Langauge** models combine both the vision and language modalities. One characteristic that helps define these models is their ability to process both images (vision) and natural language text (language). This process depends on the inputs, outputs, and the task these models are asked to perform. This repositiory contains Flamingo model which is one of the effective and efficient models in this category.
